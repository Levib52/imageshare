        <p>I created this web application as a demonstration of my full stack development skillset with the php framework laravel.</p>
        <p>The code for this application can be found at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Levib52/imageshare">https://github.com/Levib52/imageshare</a>.</p>

        <p>I designed the registeration and login to use limited verification so that you may use any fake email you choose to register and test the functionality. You can delete the account
        you create from the update profile tab and it will remove the account and any pictures you upload.</p>
        <p>This web application was built using the following languages/frameworks/technologies:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>laravel 7</li>
            <li>php</li>
            <li>html5</li>
            <li>css3</li>
            <li>scss</li>
            <li>javascript</li>
            <li>jquery</li>
            <li>mysql</li>
            <li>apache</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thank you for viewing my application,</p>
        <p>-Levi</p>
